      This is a project about the coffee machine interface in CIT, which is only open to master students, PHD & faculty. In this study, I recorded observations
      from the users as well as conducting interviews on the users regarding their experiences and expectation of the interface design. I also created two personas
      along with 1 storyboard to illustrate the current issue with the coffee machine interface.

      <div style="color:#475906;">
        <ol>
          <li>People always ignore the “WARNING: DO NOT CLOSE  DOOR WITH HAND” warning, including me when I’m first using it. This happened for all 3 users.</li>
          <li>One user hasn’t used the coffee machine in CIT before, he is very shy and very struggled about what he could do. 1 faculty came and noticed the phenomena, she kindly explained how it should be used. And the user’s comment is: “Oh sorry I haven’t used it before, I don’t know that I have to put the coffee pods in manually. It looks really confusing. Thank you.”</li>
          <li>One user forgot to press the ‘OPEN button’ before she made the selection of how she would like the pods to be roasted. It seems it is not her first time using this machine. . She seems to be very busy and impatient. 
          </li>

      </div>
      <h3 id="interview-questions" style="color:#e1622f">Interview Questions</h3>
      <p style="color:#60760eec;">Background: Interview happened at the CIT kitchen, and the coffee machine is only open to faculty, master and phd.</p>
      <p style="color:#60760eec;">First, say hi to warm up. </p>
      <div style="color:#475906;">
        <ol>
          <li>Morning/Hi, How are you? How’s your day?</li>
          <li>Are you a faculty or a student - master or phd?  (PS: I’m limiting the question to master and phd because the coffee machine at CIT is only open to faculty, master and phd.)</li>
          <li>Do you have a heavy workload normally? How long would you spend in the CIT office to finish your work or hang out?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p style="color:#60760eec;">Then, ask question to know the user’s habits.</p>
      <div style="color:#475906;">
        <ol>
          <li>Are you at the kitchen for the coffee ? If so, how frequently do you use this coffee machine? If not, how often do you use the kitchen?</li>
          <li>Which coffee roast do you usually make? Mild, Medium, Hot, Iced? </li>
          <li>Do you know that different types of roast actually yield different amounts of coffee given the same amount of pods? How do you feel about this fact? </li>
          <li>How do you normally solve problem 3? Will you use another bag of pods or will you add some water to your coffee?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p style="color:#60760eec;">If the users have experienced(at each level is fine) with the coffee machine, continue:</p>
      <div style="color:#475906;">
        <ol>
          <li>Are you familiar with each button? When you first use it, do you find it hard to know the workflow of the machine? Are you familiar with it now (if you use it more than once)?</li>
          <li>Have you ever pressed the ” iced” button? What do you think that it would do?</li>
          <li>What is your primary expectation of the coffee machine interface? </li>
          <li>Do you like the current coffee machine interface and do you find any trouble using it?</li>
          <li>Do you have any suggestions to help improve the coffee machine interface?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h3 id="summary-of-the-answers" style="color:#e1622f">Summary of the answers</h3>
      <div style="color:#475906;">
        <ol>
          <li>Without a clear instruction of the step of using a coffee machine, many people don’t know they have to click on open first + place the coffee pods before brewing. Also, coffee machines always break down unexpectedly.</li>
          <li>Many people think “Iced” means iced water not iced roast and this is incorrect and they don’t know the “iced roast” made by this coffee machine is indeed hot.</li>
          <li>Many people are annoyed that different roast yields different amounts of coffee providing the same amount of pods and some of them need to use multiple bags of pods for a coffee. There is never an instruction of this and the coffee machine makers assume their users all know the difference in advance.</li>
          <li>Another interesting problem with the interface is that the website link on the interface is “404 not found” and this is really confusing for people who are trying to search for information.</li>
          <li>People all think that it would be better if there are some hints (i.e. number) suggesting the workflow. If there is a “1” besides the “OPEN” button, “2” besides the “MILD, MEDIUM, DARK, ICED” buttons, it would be much easier to use and can avoid many embarrassing moments.</li>
        </ol>
